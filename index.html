DOCTYPE declaration always comes first. Any other code, like this comment, must follow it. Comments also don't have to be within the HTML root element.

<!--
TLDR: Everything is wrapped in tags. Different tags do different things. Tags have attributes that change their behavior. Browsers build a tree of tags to represent the document structure, and then applies styles to the tree's nodes (tags), and then loads scripts (JavaScript) that can act on the document through the tree.

<head>
<!--
The Head tag contains metadata about the document. Nothing in here will be rendered, and it only accepts certain types of elements. 

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head
-->

    <meta charset="utf-8">
<!-- 
Placing the Meta tag listing character encoding first helps browsers safely render the page. You should always have this tag.

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<!-- 
The Meta tag for viewport ensures the page always fits the screen (provided none of your content overflows). The one here is the most common, and usually doesn't need to be changed. You should always have this tag.

    <title>Web Dev Rocketsled</title>
<!-- 
This is the document title. This appears in browser tabs, is the default name for a bookmark, and is read out loud by screen readers. You should always have this tag.

The Navigation tag <nav> identifies a region of the page used for navigation (either to other pages or within the current page).

The article element identifies a standalone piece of content in the document (think article of clothing, not news article). Usually, you won't want too many of these.

<!-- 
Every page should have a H1 tag with content similar to or the same as the Title tag.

Usually you want it inside your Main element instead of your site header, because it should describe what is on the specific page, not your site. 

Always use headings in descending order.
